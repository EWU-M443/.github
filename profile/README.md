<b>Summary:</b> Math 443 a five-credit independent study of current topics in numerical methods. This course introduces students to scientific computing by providing a survey of computational techniques to solve scalar nonlinear equations, numerical integration and differentiation, and initial value problems. Additional topics may include Monte Carlo simulation, curve fitting, and linear programming.

<b>Expectations:</b> The prerequisite for Math 443 is Math 163 and Math 231 or permission of the instructor. As always, sufficient mastery of prerequisite material is the responsibility of the student. To find success in this class, one must spend time with the material outside the classroom. Students should prepare to dedicate two to three hours outside of class for each hour of lecture. This time explicitly includes reading the text and understanding homework exercises.

<b>Objectives:</b> Students who complete Math 443 will leave the course with an understanding of numerical techniques in order to perform the following tasks: approximation definite integrals, approximation of solutions of initial value problems, and estimation of roots of nonlinear scalar equations. The course will also include an introduction to solving linear systems of equations. Success in Math 443 will be measured in part by achievement of the following course objectives.  Students shall

  *  Compare the error from a numerical calculus approximation to the estimate;
  *  Implement a numerical approximation to a solution of an initial value problem;
  *  Employ and analyze a prescribed method to find a root of a nonlinear equation (with knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach);
  *  Produce a report that contains contextualized numerical results.

<b>Text:</b> This course will rely on several references, including

   * Liu and Otken: First Semester in Numerical Analysis 
   * Kong, Siauw, and Bayen: Python Programming And Numerical Methods: A Guide For Engineers And Scientists
   * Chapra and Klough: Applied Numerical Methods with Python

<b>Communication:</b> I will answer my email <lynch@ewu.edu> as usual, and email is the best way to communicate with me. 

<b>Office Hours:</b> My office (KGS 311) hours are Tuesday/Thursday from 12:30-1:30 p.m. If those hours conflict, I would be pleased to arrange an alternate appointment.  I am also available by Zoom.  Contact me for a meeting request.

<b>Academic Honesty:</b> EWU expects the highest standards of academic integrity of its students.  Violation of the EWU Academic Integrity Policy may result in an XF for the course. These violations include (but are not limited to) turning in work that is copied from another source, misuse of technology, and using prohibited items on an exam. Students are responsible for understanding what may be considered such a violation.

<b>Learning Statement:</b> Students who have an approved accommodation plan through Support Services (Hargreaves 019, 509-359-6871, sass@ewu.edu) should discuss their plan with me at the beginning of the term. Students who have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that may require an accommodation should contact Support Services to learn more about available assistance.

<b>Religious Exception Statement:</b> Students who wish to request an accommodation for reasons of faith or conscience should refer to EWU Policy 403-01. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of each term using the Holidays and Religious Accommodations Request Form.

<b>Title IX Statement:</b> EWU recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people. Sexual misconduct will NOT be tolerated at EWU. If you have been subjected to sexual misconduct, we encourage you to report this matter promptly. As a faculty member, I am interested in promoting a safe and healthy environment, and should I learn of any sexual misconduct I must report the matter to the Title IX Coordinator. Should you want to report to a confidential source you may contact any of the following: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS, 509.359.2366), Sexual Assault Family Trauma (SAFeT, 24 hours, 509.624.7273), First Call for Help (24 hours, 509.838.4428), National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (24 hours, 800.273.8255).
